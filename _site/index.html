<p>Today, <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">the Recurse Center</a> (RC) welcomed guests and potential applicants to the space in an effort to offer a <em>first-hand</em> preview of what it’s like to be part of a batch and the RC community.</p>

<hr />
<p>My time there was mostly spent on three main things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finalizing this site and writing its first entry.</li>
  <li>Learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-systems</a> and the old-school HP ColorPro plotter. Various people at RC have contributed to <a href="https://github.com/WesleyAC/plotter-tools">a collection of tools</a> to make the plotter work.  The repo’s main contributor happened to be at RC that day and spent their time in the plotter room as well, working on a second plotting machine. They so patiently explained the basics to me and answered my questions when I ran into issues. I worked on a few different designs including:
    <ul>
      <li>Dragon curves</li>
      <li>Koch curves</li>
      <li>Koch snowflakes</li>
      <li>Sierpinski triangles (not working yet)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A LED jewelry workshop lead by a person currently attending RC. Here are images of the trinkets I made:</li>
</ul>
