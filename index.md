# RC visit
#### 2019-12-19

Today, [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (RC) welcomed guests and potential applicants to the space in an effort to offer a _first-hand_ preview of what it's like to be part of a batch and the RC community.

My time there was mostly spent on three main things:
 - Finalizing this site and writing its first entry.
 - Learning about [L-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) and the old-school HP ColorPro plotter. Various people at RC have contributed to [a collection of tools](https://github.com/WesleyAC/plotter-tools) to make the plotter work.  The repo's main contributor happened to be at RC that day and spent their time in the plotter room as well, working on a second plotting machine. They so patiently explained the basics to me and answered my questions when I ran into issues. I worked on a few different designs including:
    - Dragon curves
    - Koch curves
    - Koch snowflakes
    - Sierpinski triangles (not working yet)
  - A LED jewelry workshop lead by a person currently attending RC. Here are images of the trinkets I made:
